Table 1, \"Description of fields in a layer name,\" is central to this, outlining the structure of a layer name.  This structure likely includes fields for information like the element's originator (Table 2 provides codes for this field), classification (Table 3), presentation (Tables 4 and 5), and status (Table 6). Figure 1 likely visually depicts the \"Layer name format,\" and Figure 2 provides an \"Example of layer name structure.\"\n\nThe standard aims to improve interoperability and data exchange between different parties involved in construction projects by standardizing CAD layer organization.  Annex A and Annex B provide alphabetical lists of main and recommended sub-elements, respectively, further supporting this goal of structured documentation.

The image likely shows a table (though the resolution and cropping prevent full comprehension) outlining the structure for these layers, likely specifying main elements and sub-elements.  While specific numerical values or measurements are not discernible in the provided image excerpt, the accompanying text emphasizes the flexibility of the revised standard, allowing users to combine main and sub-elements based on project requirements.  This suggests the table in the image would detail these elements and their possible combinations.\n\nThe document is identified as a Singapore Standard (CP 83 Part 1), specifically addressing CAD practices within the construction industry.  The text mentions its use in Electronic Development Application (EDA) and Electronic Submission System (eSS) processes, adopted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Building Construction Authority (BCA) respectively.  This highlights the standard's importance for regulatory compliance in Singapore.  The text also notes that CAD vendors have developed tools supporting CP 83, and BCA provides training on its implementation.\n\nThe key concept illustrated is the standardization of CAD layer naming.  This revision streamlines industry practices for both building and infrastructure projects, encompassing architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, and electrical works.  The standard aims to improve interoperability and data exchange between different stakeholders involved in construction projects in Singapore.  A cautionary note regarding potential patent rights related to elements within the standard is also included.\n"

The image, Figure 2, provides a visual example of this layer naming structure.\n\n**Image Content:** Figure 2 depicts a simple diagram illustrating the structure of a layer name:  `A-WALLPARP-E-N`.  It's broken down into four fields separated by hyphens.  The diagram uses color-coding and annotations to explain each field.\n\n**Technical Specifications:** The document specifies the codes for each field in the layer name.  The first character of the \"Presentation\" field (third field in the example) is defined in Table 4 (not shown in the excerpt but referenced).  For element graphics, the second character of the \"Presentation\" field represents the projection/view as detailed in Table 5 (also not shown). The \"Status\" field (fourth field) uses a single character code from Table 6 (not shown).  The excerpt mentions \"TL\" as a possible code for the \"Presentation\" field if Text and Title are on separate layers.\n\n**Code or Standard Reference:** The document explicitly refers to a Singapore Standard (SS) and includes licensing information from Enterprise Singapore.  The order number (6800055693) and download date (2019-08-29) are also provided, indicating the specific version of the standard.  Sections 4.4.3.2, 4.4.4, and 4.4.5 are mentioned, relating to the second character of the presentation field, the status field, and the user-defined field, respectively.\n\n**Key Concepts:** The standard aims to establish a consistent and unambiguous layer naming system for A&A drawings.  The structure facilitates organization and communication between different parties involved in a project. The example, `A-WALLPARP-E-N`, demonstrates the following:\n\n* **Originator Code (A-):**  \"A\" represents the Architect who created the layer.\n* **Element Name (WALLPARP):** \"WALLPARP\" identifies the element as a parapet wall (\"WALL\") with \"PARP\" likely being a sub-element or specific type.\n* **Presentation (E-):** \"E\" indicates that the layer contains element graphics.\n* **Status (N):** \"N\" denotes that the wall is \"New Work.\"\n\nThe standard also allows for a user-defined field for further customization, though it stresses the importance of documenting and communicating the meaning of any user-defined codes.\n"

However, the accompanying text refers to Tables 5 and 6, which define single-character codes for the Presentation and Status fields, respectively.

The system uses a structured, coded approach, with each field in the layer name providing specific information about the layer's contents and purpose.

The text provides further examples like `A2` for a second architect and `C-` for Civil Engineer.\n\n2. **Element:** Describes the building element the layer represents.  The example uses `WALLPARP`, with `WALL` being the main element and `PARP` (parapet) the sub-element.  Other examples include `AREACALC` (area calculation) and `ANOT` (annotation).\n\n3. **Presentation:**  Indicates the type of information on the layer.  `E-` signifies \"element graphics.\" Table 5, referenced but not shown, lists other codes. The text mentions \"I-\" for tabulated information and \"D-\" for dimensions.\n\n4. **Status (Optional):**  Specifies the status of the element, particularly for additions and alterations.  `N` represents \"new work.\" Table 6, also referenced but not shown, defines other status codes.\n\n5. **User-Defined (Optional):** Allows for project-specific categorization.
